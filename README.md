# gardendashboard-javafx
JavaFX app (Desktop version of Gardendashboard) to remotely control a garden robot with PubNub

This is still a simulation, the communication with this app and the remote device is through pubnub and OpenCV library is used for the Video feed.
For now, it is just capturing feeds from the laptop webcam.
